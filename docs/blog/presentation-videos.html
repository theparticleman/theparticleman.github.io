<h2>Presentation Videos</h2>
<div class='published-date'>Published â€¢ October 29, 2021</div>

<p>Presenting is a thing I've been doing for the last 10 or 15 years. Maybe longer, depending on exactly how you count. I think it's a great way to share with others and give back to the community (in my case mostly the software development community). It's something I'd <a href="/blog/getting-started-presenting">encourage everyone to do</a>. Whether you're an expert or just getting started, you have something to share.</p>

<p>The last year or two have necessitated a lot of changes, and my presentation experiences are no exception. While in the past I've presented mostly at in-person conferences, the last year or two has meant presenting exclusively at virtual conferences. Virtual conferences have some drawbacks compared to in-person conferences, but they have some advantages too. One advantage is that many times the presentations are recorded and can be watched later.</p>

<p>I've recorded several presentations the last year or two, so I thought I'd post them here in one big list to make them easier to find. Enjoy!</p>

<h3>One Year of Remote Mob Programming</h3>

<p>This presenataion was at XP 2021. I share some of my experiences doing remote mob programming for a year. You can read the white paper that goes along with the video <a href="https://www.agilealliance.org/resources/experience-reports/one-year-of-remote-mob-programming/">here</a>.</p>

<h3>"Microservices Will Save Your Life" and Other Lies</h3>

<p>This presentation was at Agile 2021. I had fun refuting some claims about software development I've heard throughout my career. I gave a longer version of this presentation at Big Mountain Data &amp; Dev 2020. You can watch that version <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mwjn6nrSI2M">here</a>.</p>

<h3>TDD - It's About More Than Just the Tests</h3>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GAamdFa9VPw" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>I've given this presentation a few times, but this version was for Reliable Web Summit. It's an introduction to test driven development using a little explanation but mostly using a live coding example.</p>

<h3>The Legend of Zelda, ASCII Art, Hexagonal Architecture, and You</h3>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cqHRfBpekpQ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>This presentation is part experience report, part code review, and partly an introduction to several software architecture patterns. It's based on my experience converting <a href="https://www.fableofgriselda.com/">Fable of Griselda</a> from a console application to a web application.</p>

<h3>Absolute Beginner's Guide to Docker</h3>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/db5jLi6BnaI" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>I've given this presentation a few times, but this version was as a Jetbrains webinar. The Jetbrains folks were awesome, and we got a lot of good questions and interaction as part of the webinar.</p>

This HTML was written by hand, like they used to do it back in 
the good old days, up hill in the snow both ways!
Well, okay, I mean I wrote most of it by hand.
And I wrote some code to put the rest of it together.
But the code was written by hand. And the HTML that
I put in the code that put it in here was written by hand.
So that's pretty close, right?
