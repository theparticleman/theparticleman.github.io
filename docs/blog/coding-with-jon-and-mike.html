<h2>Coding with Jon and Mike</h2>
<div class='published-date'>Published â€¢ June 14, 2022</div>

<p>I think good software development practices can make a big difference when creating software. 
I'm thinking of things like test driven development, pair and mob programming, and automated continuous integration and continous delivery pipelines to name a few.</p>

<p>But one challenge I've noticed with having people use these types of practices is that it can be hard to really "get" them until you see them in action.</p>

<p>For example, one time while attending the <a href="http://utahsc.org">Utah Software Craftsmanship</a> group, another developer and I paired on a coding exercise.
This particular developer had a few years of experience, and had attended the group a few times.
But he didn't have a lot of exposure to test driven development.
During the coding exercise I tried to guide us through a test driven path to solving the problem.
I didn't do anything wild or crazy, just tried to follow the <a href="http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.TheThreeRulesOfTdd">rules of TDD</a> (since practicing was one of the purposes of the coding exercise).</p>

<p>At the end of the coding exercise the other developer thanked me.
He said that through the things I did during the coding exercise he had finally started to understand what test driven development was all about.
Because he saw it, it was easier for him to "get" it.</p>

<p>That experience stayed with me.
I thought several times about creating a series of videos or something to help people see things like test driven development in practice to help make it easier to "get" them.
Unfortunately, I never got around to making those videos.</p>

<p>Fortunately, my friend <a href="http://blog.softwareontheside.com/">Mike</a> and I <em>did</em> get around to making some of those videos!</p>

<p>Mike and I had an experience similar to the one I mentioned above with a coding exercise.
We decided to pair on a coding exercise together (again, at the Utah Software Craftsmanship group).
We didn't introduce each other to test driven development, but had a good time working on the exercise.
At the end of the meeting, everyone got back together and discussed how the exercise had gone.
Mike and I talked about how our experience went.
As we did, one of the other attendees said something like, "I wish I could have been a fly on the wall during that pairing session!"</p>

<p>That got us thinking that we should find a way to let people be that fly on the wall because they might get some value from it.
So we created a YouTube channel, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPeEnPwRkqmF-_1rCbE7-lA/featured">Coding with Jon and Mike</a>.</p>

<p>So far we have about half a dozen videos.
About half are us doing test driven development.
The other half are us working through a refactoring project (another great software development practice).
And since it's both of us, they are obviously examples of pair programming in action.</p>

<p>If this kind of thing sounds interesting to you, give a few of the videos a watch.
Let us know what you think.
Let us know what you'd like to see more of and what you'd like to see less of.</p>

<p>Hopefully being able to see these videos will help some people be able to "get" some of these extremely helpful software development practices.</p>

This HTML was written by hand, like they used to do it back in 
the good old days, up hill in the snow both ways!
Well, okay, I mean I wrote most of it by hand.
And I wrote some code to put the rest of it together.
But the code was written by hand. And the HTML that
I put in the code that put it in here was written by hand.
So that's pretty close, right?
