<h2>Mario TD Screenshots</h2>
<div class='published-date'>Published â€¢ November 24, 2007</div>

<p>I decided I should post some images to sell the game a little better.Â  Here are images from a couple of the current levels.</p>

<p><img src="/images/mario-td-screenshots-1.png" alt="Mario TD screenshot 1" /> </p>

<p>My Fire Marios can handle these guys.</p>

<p><img src="/images/mario-td-screenshots-2.png" alt="Mario TD screenshot 2" /></p>

<p>I think the giant fish that the Frog Marios throw are pretty cool.</p>

<p><img src="/images/mario-td-screenshots-3.png" alt="Mario TD screenshot 3" /></p>

<p>This is what the final level currently looks like.Â  The Hammer Bro. Mario and Tanooki Mario make a mean combination!</p>

This HTML was written by hand, like they used to do it back in 
the good old days, up hill in the snow both ways!
Well, okay, I mean I wrote most of it by hand.
And I wrote some code to put the rest of it together.
But the code was written by hand. And the HTML that
I put in the code that put it in here was written by hand.
So that's pretty close, right?
