<h2>A Website Reborn</h2>
<div class='published-date'>Published â€¢ May 23, 2021</div>

<p>It's all GoDaddy's fault.</p>

<p>Back in the day when I used GoDaddy as a domain name registrar they also had a blogging service. It was terrible. But it supported Windows Live Writer, which meant I didn't have to author blog posts through a terrible web UI. That seemed like a reasonable trade-off at the time.</p>

<p>Eventually I moved all my domain names from GoDaddy to something less horrible. Maybe I'll write a blog post about that some time. But when I stopped using GoDaddy I lost access to it's blogging platform. Not that I was particularly sad about that. Except that I no longer had a blog and any SEO juice I had acquired was now gone.</p>

<p>For several years I thought about getting around to resurrecting my blog. But I wanted a site where I could have blog posts <em>and</em> have various dedicated pages for games and such. I never found a system or platform that really worked well for me, so my blog stayed dead.</p>

<p>Recently static website generators have become a thing. I've used a few, like Hugo and Jekyll. I like them in theory, but even those are kind of overkill. I just want some simple, hand-crafted, artisanal HTML and CSS. Is that too much to ask?</p>

<p>So like any self-respecting software developer, when it seems like the existing solutions are too complicated, what did I do? I made mine own that's arguably more complicated, of course!</p>

<p>This site (in it's current incarnation at least) is now a generated static website. You can check out the code <a href="https://github.com/theparticleman/theparticleman.github.io">here</a>. You probably don't want to use it, since it's specifically for my use case. But, you know, if that's your thing, go for it.</p>

<p>I still have the posts from the previous incarnation of my blog. Those posts aren't all here right now, but I plan to bring them over as I have time. I'll also probably bring over some posts that I wrote for the <a href="https://www.pluralsight.com/tech-blog">Pluralsight Tech Blog</a> when I worked there.</p>

<p>Anyway, that's a bit of a bridge between the old content that will live here and whatever new content I end up putting here. Hopefully it's not all too confusing.</p>

<p>And if it is too confusing, or wrong, or terrible in any other way, feel free to blame GoDaddy.</p>

This HTML was written by hand, like they used to do it back in 
the good old days, up hill in the snow both ways!
Well, okay, I mean I wrote most of it by hand.
And I wrote some code to put the rest of it together.
But the code was written by hand. And the HTML that
I put in the code that put it in here was written by hand.
So that's pretty close, right?
