<h2>This is Fine</h2>
<div class='published-date'>Published • April 01, 2022</div>

<p>I'm a big fan of KC Green's <em>This is Fine</em> comic.
You should <a href="http://gunshowcomic.com/648">check it out</a> if you're not familiar with it.
You should also go visit <a href="http://kcgreendotcom.com/index.html">KC's site</a> and support him if you feel so inclined.</p>

<p>In my <a href="grumble-grumble">last post</a> I wrote about a command line tool inspired by The Legend of Zelda.
I made another one, but this time inspired by the <em>This is Fine</em> comic!</p>

<p><img src="/images/this-is-fine.gif" alt="This is Fine command line tool" /></p>

<p>Pretty much the same as the <code>grumble</code> command line tool, but this time with 100% more This is Fine.
I used <a href="https://spectreconsole.net/">Spectre.Console</a> again, but this time I figured out a way to use the CanvasImage but still draw the image centered on the screen.
It was much quicker to just edit the image and then draw it instead of having to translate every pixel into code.
Maybe I'll go back and refactor <code>grumble</code> to do the same thing...</p>

<p>On some of the drawable items in Spectre.Console there is an extension method to easily center things.
Not so with CanvasImage (or at least not that I've found so far).
It may still be worth submitting a pull request for that.</p>

<p>This time in addition to providing just a Windows version, there are also MacOS and Linux versions.
I don't have a great way to test them, so there are probably issues.
But it's a start at least.
If you find any issues with them, <a href="/contact">let me know</a>.</p>

This HTML was written by hand, like they used to do it back in 
the good old days, up hill in the snow both ways!
Well, okay, I mean I wrote most of it by hand.
And I wrote some code to put the rest of it together.
But the code was written by hand. And the HTML that
I put in the code that put it in here was written by hand.
So that's pretty close, right?
