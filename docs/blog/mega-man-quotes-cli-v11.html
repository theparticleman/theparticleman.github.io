<h2>Mega Man Quotes CLI v1.1</h2>
<div class='published-date'>Published â€¢ June 22, 2022</div>

<p>I posted about <a href="mega-man-quotes">Mega Man quote</a> in general previous.
Just a quick update.
v1.1 of the <a href="https://github.com/theparticleman/MegaManQuotesCli/releases/tag/v1.1">CLI tool</a> is now released.</p>

<p><img src="/images/mega-man-quotes-cli-v11.png" alt="Mega Man Quotes CLI v1.1" /></p>

<p>The big change is that now, in addition to printing out a quote, the author's name, the source if available, and a snazzy picture of Mega Man, it now also will print out a permalink to the quote.
This hopefully makes it easier to share quotes you like with your friends and co-workers.</p>

This HTML was written by hand, like they used to do it back in 
the good old days, up hill in the snow both ways!
Well, okay, I mean I wrote most of it by hand.
And I wrote some code to put the rest of it together.
But the code was written by hand. And the HTML that
I put in the code that put it in here was written by hand.
So that's pretty close, right?
