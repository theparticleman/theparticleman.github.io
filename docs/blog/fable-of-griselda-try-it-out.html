<h2>Fable of Griselda - Try it Out</h2>
<div class='published-date'>Published • August 21, 2008</div>

<p>So I have Fable of Griselda to a point that it's almost starting to look like a real game and it's almost fun to play for a few minutes at least.  And that's good since the Bootleg Demake competition I'm making this for is over on August 31st.  </p>

<p>The "installation" process is typical.  Just unzip the files somewhere (doesn't matter where).  Then run Griselda.exe.  You need the .NET Framework 2.0 in order to run this.  If you have Vista you should already have the framework.  If you have XP or older you may or may not have it.  If you're not sure just try running the program.  If you don't have the framework installed then the program won't run.  In that case go download the framework from here.</p>

<p>To play:</p>

<p>Arrow keys - move your hero</p>

<p>Space bar - attack with your sword</p>

<p>Escape - quit the game</p>

<p>At the moment every enemy you kill will drop something, either a heart or a gem.  It won't work that way in the final game, but having it work that way greatly faciliates debugging your item dropping system.</p>

<p>Anyway, let me know if you have any comments, suggestions or troubles.  Here's the download link:</p>

This HTML was written by hand, like they used to do it back in 
the good old days, up hill in the snow both ways!
Well, okay, I mean I wrote most of it by hand.
And I wrote some code to put the rest of it together.
But the code was written by hand. And the HTML that
I put in the code that put it in here was written by hand.
So that's pretty close, right?
