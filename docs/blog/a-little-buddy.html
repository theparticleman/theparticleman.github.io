<h2>A Little Buddy</h2>
<div class='published-date'>Published â€¢ October 06, 2008</div>

<p>Does anyone remember that little sheep desktop buddy?Â  You'd start it up and this little sheep would drop onto your desktop.Â Â  It'd walk on whatever windows you had open and run around and make little noises.Â  I used to open it a couple of times and let the sheep run into each other and climb on each other.Â  It was great.</p>

<p>The other day during lunch I was bored and was thinking about the little sheep.Â  I decided to make something similar.Â  But instead of mundane sheep I picked something cool.Â  What did I pick you ask?Â  The answer should be obvious.Â  Megaman!</p>

<p><img src="/images/a-little-buddy-1.png" alt="Mega Man buddy screenshot" /></p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>

<p>Download
<em>(Editor's note: Mega Man Buddy is not currently available.)</em></p>

<p>P.S.Â  He's not too smart yet.Â  I already have a list of improvements to make.Â  But if anyone has any suggestions I'd be happy to hear them.</p>

<p>P.P.S. .NET Framework 2.0 or higher required.</p>

<p>P.P.P.S.Â  Mono 2.0 has beenÂ released!Â  Rejoice Mac and Linux using friends!</p>

<p>P.P.P.P.S.Â  Sorry.Â  This is getting a little ridiculous, I know.Â  Left click and drag to move Megaman around.Â  Right click on Megaman to get a menu to close him.Â  That's assuming you can catch him of course.Â  What, did you expect him to be easy to catch?Â  This is Megaman we're talking about!</p>

This HTML was written by hand, like they used to do it back in

Well, okay, I mean I wrote most of it by hand.
And I wrote some code to put the rest of it together.
But the code was written by hand. And the HTML that
I put in the code that put it in here was written by hand.
So that's pretty close, right?
