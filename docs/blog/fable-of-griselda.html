<p>So I've made some progress on my entry for the Bootleg Demake competition.  It's not terribly far yet, but at least I have something to show.  I've made a couple of videos that I posted on the competition forum.  I'll post them here too.</p>

<p>Here's the <a href="https://vimeo.com/1536702">first</a> one.</p>

<p>And the <a href="https://vimeo.com/1539332">second</a> one.</p>

<p>Hopefully I'll get done soon so I can post the finished version.</p>

<p>The actual forum thread for it can be found <a href="https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=2577.0">here</a>.</p>

<p>P.S.  I've decided my blogging hosting sucks yet AGAIN.  It decided to excerpt all my entries and remove all the images from the excerpts.  I'm going to go see if I can fix it.  In the meantime, go ahead and click on the &lt;&lt; More >> tag to get the full entries WITH images.  <em>sigh</em></p>

Well, okay, I mean I wrote most of it by hand.
And I wrote some code to put the rest of it together.
But the code was written by hand. And the HTML that
I put in the code that put it in here was written by hand.
So that's pretty close, right?
