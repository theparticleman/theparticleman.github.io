<h2>Space Invaders ASCII</h2>

<p><img src="images/space-invaders-ascii-1.png" alt="Image of Space Invaders ASCII" /></p>

<p>This was another project from my university teaching days like <a href="donkey-kong-ascii">Donkey Kong ASCII</a>. I think this one is a little bit closer to the original source material than Donkey Kong.</p>

<p>Interesting tidbit: when I was running Space Invaders ASCII to get screenshots to put here, I let it just run in the background while I went off to save a screenshot. To my surprise, when I came back to the game it was playing itself! I totally forgot that I added that feature in. Much to my shagrin, the automatic play feature seems to do better than when I play manually.</p>

This HTML was written by hand, like they used to do it back in 
the good old days, up hill in the snow both ways!
Well, okay, I mean I wrote most of it by hand.
And I wrote some code to put the rest of it together.
But the code was written by hand. And the HTML that
I put in the code that put it in here was written by hand.
So that's pretty close, right?
