<h1>Presentations</h1>

<p>I've done a lot of presentations over the years. Sometimes it's nice to have a list to keep them all straight. Also, sometimes people contact me and say, "We'd like you to give a presentation. Can you give us a list of presentations you do?" This list is intended to fill both those needs.</p>

<h2>Full Length Presentations</h2>

<p>This is a list of some "standard", 60-ish minute presentations I've done. Some are mostly slides. Some are more code focused. Some are some of both.</p>

<h3>What Modern Development Should Look Like</h3>

<p>There are lots of different ways to develop software, each with different trade-offs. In this presentation I talk about some of the ways of developing software that I've experienced over my 20+ years of development that I think offer the best trade-offs.</p>

<h3>What I Learned About Software Development From Origami</h3>

<p>Are there any parallels between origami and software development? If you've done them both enough you can probably find some. In this presentation I talk about some of these parallels I've found. It has strong "software craftsmanship" undertones, but also involves attendees folding their own origami!</p>

<h3>The Legend of Zelda, ASCII Art, and Hexagonal Architecture</h3>

<p>Back in 2008 I participated in a video game programming competition. My entry was a console-based bootleg demake of the original NES version of The Legend of Zelda. Twelve years later I decided to resurrect this old code and convert it from a console application to a web application. How did the experience go? What went well? What was a horrible train wreck? And what can we learn about software architecture from the experience?</p>

<h3>Test Driven Development, Dependency Injection, and Mocking! Oh, My!</h3>

<p>Code katas and toy problems are a great way to practice the basic steps of test driven development. But when extended to actual production code, there are some additional practices needed in order to apply test driven development effectively. This presentation is a demonstration of some of those additional practices.</p>

<h3>Pair and Mob Programming - AMA</h3>

<p>Pair and mob (ensemble) programming are terms that many people have heard of, but few have experienced in a professional environment. Without much experience, it can be hard to know how well these practices might fit in to your environment. The goal of this presentation is to help people get more information about these practices from someone who has been using them professionally for over a decade.</p>

<h3>How Not to Build a Static Website</h3>

<p>There are a lot of great tools people can use to generate static websites. This presentation isn't about those tools. This presentation is about why I chose to write my own static website generator, how it turned out, and why sometimes doing the wrong thing can be the right thing.</p>

<h3>Absolute Beginner's Guide To Docker</h3>

<p>Docker and containers are very powerful, useful tools. But there's also a lot to learn, especially for those less familiar with them. This presentation is all about getting started with Docker in a development environment.</p>

</ul>

<h3>"Microservices Will Save Your Life" and Other Lies</h3>

<p>Lots of people make lots of claims about how to develop software. Some of these claims are true. Others aren't. This presentation is about some of those untrue claims and how you can figure out which is which for yourself.</p>

<h3>TDD - It's About More Than Just the Tests</h3>

<p>A lot of people confuse unit testing and test driven development. In this presentation we talk about the difference and demonstrate what TDD looks like in a live coding demo.</p>

<h2>Short presentations</h2>

<p>These presentations are much shorter, typically around 20 minutes. They are all mostly slides.</p>

<h3>Ideas in Software Development That Are Clear, Simple, and Wrong</h3>

<p>Sometimes in software development, a series of simple, logical steps can lead us to a solution that is elegant, makes complete sense, and is the exact wrong thing to do. Rather than solving all of our problems, these solutions lead to late, poor-quality software. And they make the lives of the people involved miserable along the way.</p>

<h3>Mob Programming RPG</h3>

<p>When learning mob programming, most people are introduced early to the roles of driver and navigator. But did you know there are many other roles you can fulfill besides these two fundamental roles? This presentation is about some of those other roles.</p>

<h3>The Answer to Let's Encrypt, certbot, and Everything</h3>

<p>Want to listen to me rant about how doing the right time is sometimes WAY more complicated than it needs to be? Then this is the presentation for you!</p>

</ul>

<h2>Interactive</h2>

<p>These are more interactive activities, usually done in the form of a workshop. They have a small presentation component but are mostly code-based.</p>

<h3>Practing Starting New Things</h3>

<p>A lot of us do our day to day development work in existing code bases. But sometime the right way to solve a problem is to start something new. How good are you at starting something new? This workshop is a great way to practice and get better at starting new code projects.</p>

<h3>TDD - It's About More Than Just the Tests</h3>

<p>The presentation version of this workshop is all about demonstrating the steps of test driven development. This workshop is all about practicing them.</p>

</ul>

<h3>Vanilla Web Kata</h3>

<p>Did you know that it's possible to create a fully functional website without any frontend frameworks, task runners, transpilers, or minifiers? Sometimes we forget that we don't need all the extra complexity of the current frontend frameworks. Sometimes the correct answer is just writing some simple text files. This workshop is practicing some of those fundamental skills. </p>

This HTML was written by hand, like they used to do it back in 
the good old days, up hill in the snow both ways!
Well, okay, I mean I wrote most of it by hand.
And I wrote some code to put the rest of it together.
But the code was written by hand. And the HTML that
I put in the code that put it in here was written by hand.
So that's pretty close, right?
