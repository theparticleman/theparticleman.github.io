<h2>Gauntlet ASCII - Survival Edition</h2>

<p><img src="images/gauntlet-ascii-survival-edition-1.png" alt="Image of Gauntlet ASCII - Survival Edition" /></p>

<p>This is another university teaching project like <a href="donkey-kong-ascii">Donkey Kong ASCII</a>.</p>

<p>Where did the "Survival Edition" part come from you ask? Good question. As I was developing the game, I had the food generation and health depletion parts of the game working. I went to implement the enemy generation and movement functionality. I'd run the game and then go find a corner to hide in while I watched the enemies spawn and move around to make sure they were working correctly. Every once in a while I'd dart out to get some food so I wouldn't die and could watch enemies spawn and move longer. I ended up starting to have fun trying to get the food and see how long I could last even though I knew there was no way I could ever defeat all the enemies, since I hadn't implemented a way to <em>stop</em> enemies from spawning. Since I was having some fun with it, I decided to just leave the game as is. I did implement a timer so that there was technically a way to end the game successfully. I don't think I've ever lasted long enough for the timer to run out, and I don't remember how I implemented the end. Maybe some time I'll have to sit down and actually beat the game so I can find out. Or just look at the source code...</p>

This HTML was written by hand, like they used to do it back in 
the good old days, up hill in the snow both ways!
Well, okay, I mean I wrote most of it by hand.
And I wrote some code to put the rest of it together.
But the code was written by hand. And the HTML that
I put in the code that put it in here was written by hand.
So that's pretty close, right?
