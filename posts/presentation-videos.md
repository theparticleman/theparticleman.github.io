Presenting is a thing I've been doing for the last 10 or 15 years. Maybe longer, depending on exactly how you count. I think it's a great way to share with others and give back to the community (in my case mostly the software development community). It's something I'd [encourage everyone to do](/blog/getting-started-presenting). Whether you're an expert or just getting started, you have something to share.

The last year or two have necessitated a lot of changes, and my presentation experiences are not exception. While in the past I've presented mostly at in-person conferences, the last year or two has meant presenting exclusively at virtual conferences. Virtual conferences have some drawbacks compared to in-person conferences, but they have some advantages too. One advantage is that many times the presentations are recorded and can be watched later.

I've recorded several presentations the last year or two, so I thought I'd post them here in one big list to make them easier to find. Enjoy!

This presenataion was at XP 2021. I share some of my experiences doing remote mob programming for a year. You can read the white paper that goes along with the video [here](https://www.agilealliance.org/resources/experience-reports/one-year-of-remote-mob-programming/).

This presentation was at Agile 2021. I had fun refuting some claims about software development I've heard throughout my career. I gave a longer version of this presentation at Big Mountain Data & Dev 2020. You can watch that version [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mwjn6nrSI2M).

I've given this presentation a few times, but this version was for Reliable Web Summit. It's an introduction to test driven development using a little explanation but mostly using a live coding example.

### The Legend of Zelda, ASCII Art, Hexagonal Architecture, and You

This presentation is part experience report, part code review, and partly an introduction to several software architecture patterns. It's based on my experience converting [Fable of Griselda](https://www.fableofgriselda.com/) from a console application to a web application.

### Absolute Beginner's Guide to Docker

I've given this presentation a few times, but this version was as a Jetbrains webinar. The Jetbrains folks were awesome, and we got a lot of good questions and interaction as part of the webinar.
