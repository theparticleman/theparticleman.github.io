It's all GoDaddy's fault.

Back in the day when I used GoDaddy as a domain name registrar they also had a blogging service. It was terrible. But it supported Windows Live Writer, which meant I didn't have to author blog posts through a terrible web UI. That seemed like a reasonable trade-off at the time.

Eventually I moved all my domain names from GoDaddy to something less horrible. Maybe I'll write a blog post about that some time. But when I stopped using GoDaddy I lost access to it's blogging platform. Not that I was particularly sad about that. Except that I no longer had a blog and any SEO juice I had acquired was now gone.

For several years I thought about getting around to resurrecting my blog. But I wanted a site where I could have blog posts _and_ have various dedicated pages for games and such. I never found a system or platform that really worked well for me, so my blog stayed dead.

Recently static website generators have become a thing. I've used a few, like Hugo and Jekyll. I like them in theory, but even those are kind of overkill. I just want some simple, hand-crafted, artisanal HTML and CSS. Is that too much to ask?

So like any self-respecting software developer, when it seems like the existing solutions are too complicated, what did I do? I made mine own that's arguably more complicated, of course!

This site (in it's current incarnation at least) is now a generated static website. You can check out the code [here](https://github.com/theparticleman/theparticleman.github.io). You probably don't want to use it, since it's specifically for my use case. But, you know, if that's your thing, go for it.

I still have the posts from the previous incarnation of my blog. Those posts aren't all here right now, but I plan to bring them over as I have time. I'll also probably bring over some posts that I wrote for the [Pluralsight Tech Blog](https://www.pluralsight.com/tech-blog) when I worked there.

Anyway, that's a bit of a bridge between the old content that will live here and whatever new content I end up putting here. Hopefully it's not all too confusing.

And if it is too confusing, or wrong, or terrible in any other way, feel free to blame GoDaddy.
