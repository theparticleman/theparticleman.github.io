So I was going through Google Reader the other day trying to get caught up on some posts and I saw a post from indiegames.com about an episode on bytejacker.com where they review some of the entries from the Bootleg Demake Competition. They do a top 10 and Fable of Griselda made the top 10! It actually came in at number 5!

I think a lot of the other entries (including those that aren't on this top 10 list) are more impressive than Fable of Griselda, but I'm glad that someone liked it enough to put it on a top 10 list.

You can watch the videoÂ [here](https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x6si9w). Griselda is at around 3:00, but the whole video is pretty interesting.
