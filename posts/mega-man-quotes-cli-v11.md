I posted about [Mega Man quote](mega-man-quotes) in general previous.
Just a quick update.
v1.1 of the [CLI tool](https://github.com/theparticleman/MegaManQuotesCli/releases/tag/v1.1) is now released.

The big change is that now, in addition to printing out a quote, the author's name, the source if available, and a snazzy picture of Mega Man, it now also will print out a permalink to the quote.
This hopefully makes it easier to share quotes you like with your friends and co-workers.
