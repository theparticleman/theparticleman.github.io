One of the challenges in the software development industry is that we software developers aren't always very aware of our industry's past.

You could argue on exactly when the study of software development began, but most arguments would probably favor somewhere in the middle of the 20th century.
That means that our industry is somewhere around 70 years old.
Compared to many things in software development, that's positively ancient.
But compared to many other areas of study, the software development industry isn't even out of diapers yet.

Since our industry is so young, we've not yet figured out a great way to learn from our relatively short history.
Sometimes topics and ideas once considered fundamental to software development are rendered obsolete (think programming in machine code).
Other times, topics that were once thought outdated suddenly become relevant again (think functional programming).

Several people throughout history have made obversations about the relationship between studying the past and learning. But I'll use George Santayana's version here. "Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it" (_The Life of Reason_).

How can software developers learn from the past so that we aren't comdemned to all those past errors?
There are lots of ways we can learn from the past, but one that I've found effective is through quotes.

Quotes can be a quick and easily digestible way for people to start learning about the past.
Short quotes without much context certainly aren't the only way software developers should learn from the past.
But a short quote can be a great way to start thinking about an idea or to spark an interest to go dig deeper.

What does all this have to do with Mega Man?
In the past I've used sharing quotes to help spark discussion of and interest in various topics.
But sometimes it's easier to hear about new ideas if it doesn't come from a specific person, but rather from an idealized person.
Who better to share important, impactful software development-related quotes than the blue bomber himself, Mega Man?

In the past I've created several Slack bots around a Mega Man-themed persona to share software development-related posts.
Often I'd have several copies of these bots running simulateously to share to different Slack groups.
But I'd usually just make a copy of an existing bot and point it at a new Slack group.

One of the challenges with this is that I ended up with multiple copies of my list of quotes, which made updated that list much more time consuming, tedious, and error prone than I would have liked.
That, of course, meant that I wouldn't update the list as much as I would have liked.
