So I've made some progress on my entry for the Bootleg Demake competition.  It's not terribly far yet, but at least I have something to show.  I've made a couple of videos that I posted on the competition forum.  I'll post them here too.

Here's the [first](https://vimeo.com/1536702) one.

And the [second](https://vimeo.com/1539332) one.

Hopefully I'll get done soon so I can post the finished version.

The actual forum thread for it can be found [here](https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=2577.0).

P.S.  I've decided my blogging hosting sucks yet AGAIN.  It decided to excerpt all my entries and remove all the images from the excerpts.  I'm going to go see if I can fix it.  In the meantime, go ahead and click on the << More >> tag to get the full entries WITH images.  *sigh*
