Does anyone remember that little sheep desktop buddy?  You'd start it up and this little sheep would drop onto your desktop.   It'd walk on whatever windows you had open and run around and make little noises.  I used to open it a couple of times and let the sheep run into each other and climb on each other.  It was great.

The other day during lunch I was bored and was thinking about the little sheep.  I decided to make something similar.  But instead of mundane sheep I picked something cool.  What did I pick you ask?  The answer should be obvious.  Megaman!

P.S.  He's not too smart yet.  I already have a list of improvements to make.  But if anyone has any suggestions I'd be happy to hear them.

P.P.S. .NET Framework 2.0 or higher required.

P.P.P.S.  Mono 2.0 has been released!  Rejoice Mac and Linux using friends!

P.P.P.P.S.  Sorry.  This is getting a little ridiculous, I know.  Left click and drag to move Megaman around.  Right click on Megaman to get a menu to close him.  That's assuming you can catch him of course.  What, did you expect him to be easy to catch?  This is Megaman we're talking about!
