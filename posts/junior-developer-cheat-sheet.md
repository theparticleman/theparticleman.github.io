A friend of mine asked me today about resources for some junior developers he knows. I sent him a list of a few resources off the top of my head. But my brain kept thinking of others to suggest. So I figured I'd write down a list with a bit more thought put in to it.

# Disclaimer

By putting together this list, I'm not implying that every junior developer should immediately use every single one of these resources. Even after 20 years of professional software development there are still books that I should have read but haven't, or coding problems I should have implemented but haven't. Please don't look at this list as a wall of "look at all the things I haven't done" shame. I hope people will look at it more as a list of things they could learn more about.

And hopefully it's obvious, but this is by no means a complete list. I'm sure there will be resources that I would have put on here given only a little more thought on my part, not to mention all the resources from other peoples' experiences and opinions. But this is my list, so I'm not going to worry about every else's lists and opinions.

# Books

There are a lot of good books related to software development these days. One could argue that there are too many good books and no one has time to read them all. That's probably true. But here are a few that I often recommend to people:

* For some basic, all around good software development advice, The Pragmatic Programmer by Dave Thomas and Andy Hunt is a great read for any software developer.

* I'm a big fan of the ideas from the software craftsmanship movement. Some books that I think have a lot of valuable material on the topic include The Software Craftsman by Sandro Mancuso and The Clean Coder and Clean Craftsmanship by Robert Martin.

* Test Driven Development By Example by Kent Beck is kind of like sitting next to Kent Beck as he writes code using TDD, just in book format. It's great to be able to learn directly from one of the masters of TDD. If you're just looking to learn more about unit testing in general, this book might be a bit more than you want.

* I wish I'd had the book Apprenticeship Patterns by Dave Hoover and Adewale Oshineye when I was starting out my career. It has a bunch of patterns (surprising given the name, I know) about how to learn and grow in your career as a software developer.

* Ron Jeffries' The Nature of Software Development is a good discussion of the principles of agile software development, without all the baggage that Scrum and its following bring. I think he intended it more for engineering managers, but I think it's approachable enough that pretty much any software could benefit from it.

* In addition to agile software development, I think knowing about lean software development would benefit most software developers. This is Lean by Niklas Modig and Par Ahlstrom is a great intro to lean principles in general.
