The keyboard and mouse are both powerful input tools.
Back in the olden days, all people had was a keyboard.
(I'm sure someone even older than me will chime in about only have punch cards and switches as input devices, but that's not part of this story.)
These days you can do almost everything with mouse interaction.
Sometimes there are things you can _only_ do with a mouse.

The sweet spot in computer interaction is probably somewhere inbetween, some keyboard interaction and some mouse interaction.
But given how common mouse interaction is, sometimes people don't know how to do certain things with a keyboard, even it it would be faster and easier.

This post contains an activity to help people practice interacting with their computer using a keyboard.
Should you always interact with your computer this way?
No, probably not.
But sometimes an effective way to practice something is to turn it all the way up 11 and see what happens.
That's what this activity is going to be.

# Keyboard Jedi

But first, some history.
A long time ago, on a computer far, far away there was a program named Keyboard Jedi.
It was written by Roy Osherove.
You can read about it and download the code [here](https://osherove.com/blog/2007/6/3/train-to-be-a-keyboard-master-with-keyboard-jedi.html).
Keyboard Jedi could show keyboard shortcut keypresses (great for presentations).
It could also lock the mouse in Visual Studio so you could practice going mouseless just there.
It was a great app.

But sadly, Keyboard Jedi was written back in the pre-Windows Vista days before Microsoft switched to 64-bit and broke everything.
When I switched to Windows Vista then Keyboard Jedi no longer worked.
There were some work arounds, but they were a lot of work.

# Keyboard Sith

I really liked Keyboard Jedi, but I couldn't use it anymore.
So I did what any self-respecting software engineer would do.
I wrote my own replacement!
I called it Keyboard Sith.
You can read more about it and download it [here](becoming-a-keyboard-sith), though it's Windows only.

> As a side note, in case you're not familiar with the terms "Jedi" and "Sith", they come from Star Wars. In Star Wars, the good space wizards with laser swords are called "Jedi". The evil ones are called "Sith".

Keyboard Sith is a little lighter weight than Keyboard Jedi.
For example

# The Activity

Enough history.
On to the activity.
