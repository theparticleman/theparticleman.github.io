This HTML was written by hand, like they used to do it back in 
the good old days, up hill in the snow both ways!
Well, okay, I mean I wrote most of it by hand.
And I wrote some code to put the rest of it together.
But the code was written by hand. And the HTML that
I put in the code that put it in here was written by hand.
So that's pretty close, right?
