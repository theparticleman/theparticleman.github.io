# Presentations

I've done a lot of presentations over the years. Sometimes it's nice to have a list to keep them all straight. Also, sometimes people contact me and say, "We'd like you to give a presentation. Can you give us a list of presentations you do?" This list is intended to fill both those needs.

## Full Length Presentations

This is a list of some "standard", 60-ish minute presentations I've done. Some are mostly slides. Some are more code focused. Some are some of both.

### What Modern Development Should Look Like

There are lots of different ways to develop software, each with different trade-offs. In this presentation I talk about some of the ways of developing software that I've experienced over my 20+ years of development that I think offer the best trade-offs.

### What I Learned About Software Development From Origami

Are there any parallels between origami and software development? If you've done them both enough you can probably find some. In this presentation I talk about some of these parallels I've found. It has strong "software craftsmanship" undertones, but also involves attendees folding their own origami!

### The Legend of Zelda, ASCII Art, and Hexagonal Architecture

Back in 2008 I participated in a video game programming competition. My entry was a console-based bootleg demake of the original NES version of The Legend of Zelda. Twelve years later I decided to resurrect this old code and convert it from a console application to a web application. How did the experience go? What went well? What was a horrible train wreck? And what can we learn about software architecture from the experience?

### Test Driven Development, Dependency Injection, and Mocking! Oh, My!

Code katas and toy problems are a great way to practice the basic steps of test driven development. But when extended to actual production code, there are some additional practices needed in order to apply test driven development effectively. This presentation is a demonstration of some of those additional practices.

### Pair and Mob Programming - AMA

Pair and mob (ensemble) programming are terms that many people have heard of, but few have experienced in a professional environment. Without much experience, it can be hard to know how well these practices might fit in to your environment. The goal of this presentation is to help people get more information about these practices from someone who has been using them professionally for over a decade.

### How Not to Build a Static Website

There are a lot of great tools people can use to generate static websites. This presentation isn't about those tools. This presentation is about why I chose to write my own static website generator, how it turned out, and why sometimes doing the wrong thing can be the right thing.
